# Indexer Client Files

## [index.ts](./IndexerClient/index.ts)

Entry point for the package , handles commands and calls the appropriate functions.

## [generator.ts](./IndexerClient/generator.ts)

This file contains the code for the generator function which is responsible for generating : 
* `interfaces.ts` - This file contains the interfaces for the events and entities and enables hard type checking.

## [init.ts](./IndexerClient/init.ts)

This file contains the code for the init function which is responsible for initializing the indexer folder and generating :
* `indexer.yaml` - This file contains the configuration for the indexer. The events are read from IDL and entities are sample entities.

This file connects to the RPC and listens for events.

## [generatorFunction.ts](./ContainerFiles/generatorFunction.ts)

This file contains the code for the generator function which is responsible for generating :
* `interfaces.ts` - This file contains the interfaces for the events and entities and enables hard type checking. (This is different from the previous one as it is generated with fully working functions for entities which point to `savingFunction.ts` and `loadingFunction.ts` instead of shell functions)
* `eventRouter.ts` - This file contains the code for the event router function which is responsible for routing the events to the appropriate event handler.
